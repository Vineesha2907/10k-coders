        <p>
            Online shopping is a form of electronic commerce which allows consumers to directly buy goods or services
            from a seller over the Internet using a web browser or a mobile app. Consumers find a product of interest
            by visiting the website of the retailer directly or by searching among alternative vendors using a shopping 
            search engine, which displays the same product's availability and pricing at different e-retailers. As of 2020,
            customers can shop online using a range of different computers and devices, including desktop computers,
            laptops, tablet computers and smartphones.
