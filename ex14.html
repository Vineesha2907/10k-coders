            Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field
            at the centre of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each
            comprising two bails balanced on three stumps. The batting side scores runs by
            striking the ball bowled at one of the wickets with the bat and then running between
            the wickets, while the bowling and fielding side tries to prevent this (by preventing
            the ball from leaving the field, and getting the ball to either wicket) and dismiss
            each batter (so they are "out"). Means of dismissal include being bowled, when the
            ball hits the stumps and dislodges the bails, and by the fielding side either catching
            the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or hitting a 
            wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket.
            When ten batters have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles.
